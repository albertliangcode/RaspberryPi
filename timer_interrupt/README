Assembly version of timer interrupt with interuppt vectors preloaded. 
Dung Le, 2012
------------------------------
The bootloader should set up interrupt vectors at starting address 0x0. 
Then in our program, to use interrupt, we simply place our  irq_handler address
to the irq vector at 0x38

Note: currently the serial debug tool still has issues with the current bootloader 
( does not response after a breakpoint at interuppt). The Jtag debug tool works
nicely however.
