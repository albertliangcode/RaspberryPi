jtag bootloader
-------------------
Bootloader with interrupt vectors starting at 0x0 (kernel.img) and jtag support.
To use, copy content of binary folder to SD card. Blinking led after boot indicates 
it is working properly. 

start.elf and bootcode.bin are executed first (GPU setup...) then passed on 
to kernel.img which copies the interrupt vectors to 0x0 and initializes jtag pins
